# React Native Charts Example

This is a **work in progress** collection of charting library examples for React Native.

## My Development Environment:

Outdated versions of react-native may cause some problems, so keep them update to date.

```
$ yarn -v
1.12.3

$ npm -version
6.5.0

$ react-native -v
react-native-cli: 2.0.1
react-native: 0.57.8

$ pod --version
1.5.3

Xcode 10.1

swift 4.2.1

```

## Installation Steps

- Clone or download the repository into a directory
- yarn install / npm install
- react-native run-android / react-native run-ios
